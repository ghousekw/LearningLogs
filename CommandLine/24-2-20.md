```
$ ls -alt 
 lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.
```
```
cp I
cp frida.txt lincoln.txt
The cp command copies files or directories. Here, we copy the contents of frida.txt into lincoln.txt.
```
```
rm -r comedy
The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The -r stands for “recursive,” and it’s used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.
```
```
stdin, stdout, and stderr
What happens when you type this command?

$ echo "Hello"
Hello
The echo command accepts the string “Hello” as standard input, and echoes the string “Hello” back to the terminal as standard output.

Let’s learn more about standard input, standard output, and standard error:

standard input, abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.

standard output, abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run.

standard error, abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.
```
```
REDIRECTION
>
$ cat oceans.txt > continents.txt
> takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right. Here the standard output of cat oceans.txt is redirected to continents.txt.

Note that > overwrites all original content in continents.txt. When you view the output data by typing cat on continents.txt, you will see only the contents of oceans.txt.
```
```
REDIRECTION
>>
$ cat glaciers.txt >> rivers.txt
>> takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right. You can view the output data of the file with cat and the filename.

Here, the output data of rivers.txt will contain the original contents of rivers.txt with the content of glaciers.txt appended to it.
```
```
REDIRECTION
<
$ cat < lakes.txt
< takes the standard input from the file on the right and inputs it into the program on the left. Here, lakes.txt is the standard input for the cat command. The standard output appears in the terminal.
```
```
REDIRECTION
|
$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc  
| is a “pipe”. The | takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right. You can think of this as “command to command” redirection.

Here the output of cat volcanoes.txt is the standard input of wc. in turn, the wc command outputs the number of lines, words, and characters in volcanoes.txt, respectively.

$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > islands.txt 
Multiple |s can be chained together. Here the standard output of cat volcanoes.txt is “piped” to the wc command. The standard output of wc is then “piped” to cat. Finally, the standard output of cat is redirected to islands.txt.

You can view the output data of this chain by typing cat islands.txt.
```
```
REDIRECTION
sort
$ sort lakes.txt 
sort takes the standard input and orders it alphabetically for the standard output. Here, the lakes in sort lakes.txt are listed in alphabetical order.

$ cat lakes.txt | sort > sorted-lakes.txt 
Here, the command takes the standard output from cat lakes.txt and “pipes” it to sort. The standard output of sort is redirected to sorted-lakes.txt.
```
```
REDIRECTION
uniq
$ uniq deserts.txt 
uniq stands for “unique” and filters out adjacent, duplicate lines in a file. Here uniq deserts.txt filters out duplicates of “Sahara Desert”, because the duplicate of ‘Sahara Desert’ directly follows the previous instance. The “Kalahari Desert” duplicates are not adjacent, and thus remain.

$ sort deserts.txt | uniq
A more effective way to call uniq is to call sort to alphabetize a file, and “pipe” the standard output to uniq. Here by piping sort deserts.txt to uniq, all duplicate lines are alphabetized (and thereby made adjacent) and filtered out.

sort deserts.txt | uniq > uniq-deserts.txt 
Here we simply send filtered contents to uniq-deserts.txt, which you can view with the cat command.
```
```
REDIRECTION
grep I
$ grep Mount mountains.txt 
grep stands for “global regular expression print”. It searches files for lines that match a pattern and returns the results. It is also case sensitive. Here, grep searches for “Mount” in mountains.txt.

$ grep -i Mount mountains.txt
grep -i enables the command to be case insensitive. Here, grep searches for capital or lowercase strings that match Mount in mountains.txt.

The above commands are a great way to get started with grep. If you are familiar with regular expressions, you can use regular expressions to search for patterns in files.
```
```
REDIRECTION
grep II
$ grep -R Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
grep -R searches all files in a directory and outputs filenames and lines containing matched results. -R stands for “recursive”. Here grep -R searches the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory for the string “Arctic” and outputs filenames and lines with matched results.

$ grep -Rl Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
grep -Rl searches all files in a directory and outputs only filenames with matched results. -R stands for “recursive” and l stands for “files with matches”. Here grep -Rl searches the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory for the string “Arctic” and outputs filenames with matched results.
```
```
REDIRECTION
sed
$ sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt 
sed stands for “stream editor”. It accepts standard input and modifies it based on an expression, before displaying it as output data. It is similar to “find and replace”.

Let’s look at the expression 's/snow/rain/':

s: stands for “substitution”. it is always used when using sed for substitution.
snow: the search string, the text to find.
rain: the replacement string, the text to add in place.
In this case, sed searches forests.txt for the word “snow” and replaces it with “rain.” Importantly, the above command will only replace the first instance of “snow” on a line.

$ sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt 
The above command uses the g expression, meaning “global”. Here sed searches forests.txt for the word “snow” and replaces it with “rain”, globally. All instances of “snow” on a line will be turned to “rain”.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
nano
Nice. You just edited a file in the nano text editor. How does it work?

$ nano hello.txt
nano is a command line text editor. It works just like a desktop text editor like TextEdit or Notepad, except that it is accessible from the command line and only accepts keyboard input.

The command nano hello.txt opens a new text file named hello.txt in the nano text editor.
"Hello, I am nano" is a text string entered in nano through the cursor.
The menu of keyboard commands at the bottom of the window allow us to save changes to hello.txt and exit nano. The ^ stands for the Ctrl key.
Ctrl + O saves a file. ‘O’ stands for output.
Ctrl + X exits the nano program. ‘X’ stands for exit.
Ctrl + G opens a help menu.
clear clears the terminal window, moving the command prompt to the top of the screen.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
Bash Profile
You created a file in nano called ~/.bash_profile and added a greeting. How does this work?

$ nano ~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_profile is the name of file used to store environment settings. It is commonly called the “bash profile”. When a session starts, it will load the contents of the bash profile before executing commands.

The ~ represents the user’s home directory.
The . indicates a hidden file.
The name ~/.bash_profile is important, since this is how the command line recognizes the bash profile.
The command nano ~/.bash_profile opens up ~/.bash_profile in nano.
The text echo "Welcome, Jane Doe" creates a greeting in the bash profile, which is saved. It tells the command line to echo the string “Welcome, Jane Doe” when a terminal session begins.
The command source ~/.bash_profile activates the changes in ~/.bash_profile for the current session. Instead of closing the terminal and needing to start a new session, source makes the changes available right away in the session we are in.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
Aliases I
What happens when you store this alias in ~/.bash_profile?

alias pd="pwd"
The alias command allows you to create keyboard shortcuts, or aliases, for commonly used commands.

Here alias pd="pwd" creates the alias pd for the pwd command, which is then saved in the bash profile. Each time you enter pd, the output will be the same as the pwd command.
The command source ~/.bash_profile makes the alias pd available in the current session.
Each time we open up the terminal, we can use the pd alias.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
Aliases II
What happens when you store the following aliases in ~/.bash_profile?

alias hy="history"
hy is set as alias for the history command in the bash profile. The alias is then made available in the current session through source. By typing hy, the command line outputs a history of commands that were entered in the current session.

alias ll="ls -la"
ll is set as an alias for ls -la and made available in the current session through source. By typing ll, the command line now outputs all contents and directories in long format, including all hidden files.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
Environment Variables
What happens when you store this in ~/.bash_profile?

export USER="Jane Doe"
environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.

The line USER="Jane Doe" sets the environment variable USER to a name “Jane Doe”. Usually the USER variable is set to the name of the computer’s owner.
The line export makes the variable to be available to all child sessions initiated from the session you are in. This is a way to make the variable persist across programs.
At the command line, the command echo $USER returns the value of the variable. Note that $ is always used when returning a variable’s value. Here, the command echo $USER returns the name set for the variable.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
PS1
What happens when this is stored in ~/.bash_profile?

export PS1=">> "
PS1 is a variable that defines the makeup and style of the command prompt.

export PS1=">> " sets the command prompt variable and exports the variable. Here we change the default command prompt from $ to >>.
After using the source command, the command line displays the new command prompt.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
HOME
What happens when you type this command?

$ echo $HOME 
The HOME variable is an environment variable that displays the path of the home directory. Here by typing echo $HOME, the terminal displays the path /home/ccuser as output.

You can customize the HOME variable if needed, but in most cases this is not necessary.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
PATH
What happens when you type this command?

$ echo $PATH

/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin
PATH is an environment variable that stores a list of directories separated by a colon. Looking carefully, echo $PATH lists the following directories:

/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/bin
Each directory contains scripts for the command line to execute. The PATH variable simply lists which directories contain scripts.

For example, many commands we’ve learned are scripts stored in the /bin directory.

/bin/pwd
This is the script that is executed when you type the pwd command.

/bin/ls
This is the script that is executed when you type the ls command.
```
```
ENVIRONMENT
env
What happens when you type this command?

env
The env command stands for “environment”, and returns a list of the environment variables for the current user. Here, the env command returns a number of variables, including PATH, PWD, PS1, and HOME.

env | grep PATH 
env | grep PATH is a command that displays the value of a single environment variable. Here the standard output of env is “piped” to the grep command. grep searches for the value of the variable PATH and outputs it to the terminal.
```
```
LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Introduction to Bash Scripting
Bash (or shell) scripting is a great way to automate repetitive tasks and can save you a ton of time as a developer. Bash scripts execute within a Bash shell interpreter terminal. Any command you can run in your terminal can be run in a Bash script. When you have a command or set of commands that you will be using frequently, consider writing a Bash script to perform it.

There are some conventions to follow to ensure that your computer is able to find and execute your Bash scripts. The beginning of your script file should start with #!/bin/bash on its own line. This tells the computer which type of interpreter to use for the script. When saving the script file, it is good practice to place commonly used scripts in the ~/bin/ directory.

The script files also need to have the “execute” permission to allow them to be run. To add this permission to a file with filename: script.sh use:

chmod +x script.sh
Your terminal runs a file every time it is opened to load its configuration. On Linux style shells, this is ~/.bashrc and on OSX, this is ~/.bash_profile. To ensure that scripts in ~/bin/ are available, you must add this directory to your PATH within your configuration file:

PATH=~/bin:$PATH
Now any scripts in the ~/bin directory can be run from anywhere by typing the filename.
```
```
LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Variables
Within bash scripts (or the terminal for that matter), variables are declared by setting the variable name equal to another value. For example, to set the variable greeting to “Hello”, you would use the following syntax:

greeting="Hello"
Note that there is no space between the variable name, the equals sign, or “Hello”.

To access the value of a variable, we use the variable name prepended with a dollar sign ($). In the previous example, if we want to print the variable value to the screen, we use the following syntax:

echo $greeting
```
```
LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Conditionals
When bash scripting, you can use conditionals to control which set of commands within the script run. Use if to start the conditional, followed by the condition in square brackets ([ ]). then begins the code that will run if the condition is met. else begins the code that will run if the condition is not met. Lastly, the conditional is closed with a backwards if, fi.

A complete conditional in a bash script uses the following syntax:

if [ $index -lt 5 ]
then
  echo $index
else
  echo 5
fi
Bash scripts use a specific list of operators for comparison. Here we used -lt which is “less than”. The result of this conditional is that if $index is less than 5, it will print to the screen. If it is 5 or greater, “5” will be printed to the screen.

Here is the list of comparison operators for numbers you can use within bash scripts:

Equal: -eq
Not equal: -ne
Less than or equal: -le
Less than: -lt
Greater than or equal: -ge
Greater than: -gt
Is null: -z
When comparing strings, it is best practice to put the variable into quotes ("). This prevents errors if the variable is null or contains spaces. The common operators for comparing strings are:

Equal: ==
Not equal: !=
For example, to compare if the variables foo and bar contain the same string:

if [ "$foo" == "$bar"]
```
```
LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Loops
There are 3 different ways to loop within a bash script: for, while and until.

A for loop is used to iterate through a list and execute an action at each step. For example, if we had a list of words stored in a variable paragraph, we could use the following syntax to print each one:

for word in $paragraph
do
  echo $word
done
Note that word is being “defined” at the top of the for loop so there is no $ prepended. Remember that we prepend the $ when accessing the value of the variable. So, when accessing the variable within the do block, we use $word as usual.

Within bash scripting until and while are very similar. while loops keep looping while the provided condition is true whereas until loops loop until the condition is true. Conditions are established the same way as they are within an if block, between square brackets. If we want to print the index variable as long as it is less than 5, we would use the following while loop:

while [ $index -lt 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index=$((index + 1))
done
Note that arithmetic in bash scripting uses the $((...)) syntax and within the brackets the variable name is not prepended with a $.

The same loop could also be written as an until loop as follows:

until [ $index -eq 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index=$((index + 1))
done
```
```
LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Inputs
To make bash scripts more useful, we need to be able to access data external to the bash script file itself. The first way to do this is by prompting the user for input. For this, we use the read syntax. To ask the user for input and save it to the number variable, we would use the following code:

echo "Guess a number"
read number
echo "You guessed $number"
Another way to access external data is to have the user add input arguments when they run your script. These arguments are entered after the script name and are separated by spaces. For example:

saycolors red green blue
Within the script, these are accessed using $1, $2, etc, where $1 is the first argument (here, “red”) and so on. Note that these are 1 indexed.

If your script needs to accept an indefinite number of input arguments, you can iterate over them using the "$@" syntax. For our saycolors example, we could print each color using:

for color in "$@"
do
  echo $color
done
Lastly, we can access external files to our script. You can assign a set of files to a variable name using standard bash pattern matching using regular expressions. For example, to get all files in a directory, you can use the * character:

files=/some/directory/*
You can then iterate through each file and do something. Here, lets just print the full path and filename:

for file in $files
do
  echo $file
done
```
```
LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Aliases
You can set up aliases for your bash scripts within your .bashrc or .bash_profile file to allow calling your scripts without the full filename. For example, if we have our saycolors.sh script, we can alias it to the word saycolors using the following syntax:

alias saycolors='./saycolors.sh'
You can even add standard input arguments to your alias. For example, if we always want “green” to be included as the first input to saycolors, we could modify our alias to:

alias saycolors='./saycolors.sh "green"'
```
