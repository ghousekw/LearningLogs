## Creating custom model fields
---

>Django comes with a complete collection of model fields that you can use to build your models. However, you can also create your
own model fields to store custom data or alter the behavior of existing fields.

>We need a field that allows us to define an order for objects. An easy
way to specify an order for objects using existing Django fields is by
adding a <b>PositiveIntegerField</b> to your models. Using integers, we can
easily specify the order of objects. We can create a custom order
field that inherits from <strong>PositiveIntegerField</strong> and provides additional
behavior.

There are two relevant functionalities that we will build into our order field:

* Automatically assign an order value when no
specific order is provided.
* Order objects with respect to other fields.

Create a new fields.py file inside the courses application directory and
add the following code to it:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist
class OrderField(models.PositiveIntegerField):
    def __init__(self, for_fields=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.for_fields = for_fields
        super(OrderField, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    def pre_save(self, model_instance, add):
        if getattr(model_instance, self.attname) is None:
        # no current value
        try:
            qs = self.model.objects.all()
            if self.for_fields:
            # filter by objects with the same field values
            # for the fields in "for_fields"
                query = {field: getattr(model_instance, field)
            for field in self.for_fields}
                qs = qs.filter(**query)
                # get the order of the last item
                last_item = qs.latest(self.attname)
                value = last_item.order + 1
        except ObjectDoesNotExist:
            value = 0
            setattr(model_instance, self.attname, value)
        return value
    else:
        return super(OrderField,
        self).pre_save(model_instance, add)
```
